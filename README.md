# budget_management

This code provides a simple budget management application in a distributed system. It allows end-user to create a profile, which includes personal information and all accounts created by the end-user. The end-user is able to manage its budget in this application by adding his/her expenses.
Each user could add a new account with a balance as a total balance, and then deposit or withdraw the amount of money in it. In the end, the end-user could check the total balance of his/her accounts.
